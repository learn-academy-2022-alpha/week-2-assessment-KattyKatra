# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: An argument is the real value in a function, parameters are a generalized input for a function

  Researched answer: Arguments are the values passed when a function is called. Parameters are values at the time of function prototyping.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: Element, Index, and Array. Only element is required.

  Researched answer: Element, Index, Array. While element is the only one that is necessary, index and array are useful for full callbacks.



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: .map will create a new array of the same length, while .filter will make a new array of shorter length by removing elements.

  Researched answer: Map returns an array from the original array. Filter returns a subset of the original array. .reduce is similar to .filter but returns a single value array.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: Functions are independent, methods require an object.
  Researched answer: Methods have a "receiver" (i.e. anObject.aMethod) ,  functions can be called without a receiver and still work (i.e. someFunction(arg)).



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Breaking down an object into its individual parts

  Researched answer: Destructuring allows us to pull out data from objects and assigning them to new independent variables



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Moving everything to the top!

  Researched answer: When the interpreter moves all function declarations, variables, classes, etc to the top scope before execution
